# Rodrigo Cremella - Front End Developer ðŸ’»ðŸ“±
<br>

Hi, my name is Rodrigo ðŸ‘‹  <br>

I chose to pursue Front-End Web and Mobile programming after discovering my passion for spending long hours in front of a computer, trying out different things, and realizing that I could create anything I could imagine through code.

Previously, I worked as an SAP ABAP programmer for four years, but I later realized that in the Web Front-End area, design and code go hand in hand. That's where I found my true calling and what inspired me to make a significant change.

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer who studied at the Soy Henry bootcamp. Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge of Front-End Web development by learning new technologies like TypeScript, Next.js and Front-End Mobile development with React Native.
